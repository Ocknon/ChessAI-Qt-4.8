# ChessAI-Qt-4.8
Fully functioning Chess AI

Created in a 1 week deadline.

Has two known issues:
Castling causes the game to crash due to Move class not knowing how to store it.
AI sometimes sacrifices king if it finds that to lead to a better board state where all paths lead to both kings dead.

Both issues are easy fixes and will be fixed in the future.
